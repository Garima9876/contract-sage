"The employee agrees that any future disputes shall be resolved solely at the discretion of the employer, and the employee hereby waives all rights to legal recourse under applicable laws."

ðŸš© Why This is Anomalous (Under Indian Legal Clauses)
Violation of Natural Justice:

This clause removes the right to legal recourse, which is in violation of Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) of the Indian Constitution.

Unilateral Power Assignment:

Giving sole discretion to one party (employer) contradicts basic principles of fairness in contracts.

Illegal Waiver of Fundamental Rights:

Under Indian law, fundamental rights cannot be waived, even voluntarily.

Lack of Dispute Resolution Mechanism:

Standard legal clauses require arbitration or court recourse â€” this clause offers neither.
